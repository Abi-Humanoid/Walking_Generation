# Subbing in point COM for each joint in forward (or inverse) kinematics, to then calculate total COM

# Calculate COM for different walking phases

# Use CoM values as a trajectory 'x' -> generate ZMP via cart table model. (LIPM uses ZMP -> CoM). 
# Do smooth generation in Matlab, work backwards to get joint angles
